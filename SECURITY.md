# Security Considerations

## Contract Security Features

The `MintableToken` contract has been designed with production-grade security features based on industry best practices.

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

#### 1. **Supply Cap (MAX_SUPPLY)**
- **What**: Hard limit of 1,000,000 tokens maximum
- **Why**: Prevents unlimited inflation and protects token value
- **How**: Contract reverts if mint would exceed `MAX_SUPPLY`
- **Code**: `require(totalSupply() + MINT_AMOUNT <= MAX_SUPPLY, "max supply exceeded")`

#### 2. **Owner-Only Minting (onlyOwner)**
- **What**: Only the contract owner (your server wallet) can mint tokens
- **Why**: Prevents unauthorized minting and rug-pull attacks
- **How**: Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract with `onlyOwner` modifier
- **Note**: The owner is the CDP-managed server wallet (not externally accessible)

#### 3. **Zero Address Protection**
- **What**: Cannot mint to address(0)
- **Why**: Prevents accidental token burn
- **How**: `require(to != address(0), "mint to zero address")`

#### 4. **Event Emission**
- **What**: Emits `TokensMinted` event on every mint
- **Why**: Full transparency and on-chain audit trail
- **How**: `event TokensMinted(address indexed to, uint256 amount, uint256 newTotalSupply)`

#### 5. **Audited Dependencies**
- **What**: Uses OpenZeppelin v5.0.0 contracts
- **Why**: Battle-tested, industry-standard, professionally audited
- **Contracts**: `ERC20.sol`, `Ownable.sol`

#### 6. **Modern Solidity**
- **What**: Solidity 0.8.20+ with built-in overflow protection
- **Why**: Automatic SafeMath, prevents arithmetic exploits
- **Note**: No need for SafeMath library in 0.8.x+

### 🔒 What We Fixed

Based on Remix IDE security audit:

| Issue | Status | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| ❌ No supply cap | ✅ Fixed | Added `MAX_SUPPLY = 1,000,000 tokens` |
| ❌ publicMint function | ✅ Removed | Deleted unrestricted mint function |
| ❌ Centralization risk | ✅ Mitigated | Owner is server wallet + supply cap limits damage |
| ✅ Modern Solidity | ✅ Already good | Using 0.8.20 with overflow protection |
| ✅ OpenZeppelin | ✅ Already good | Using audited contracts |

### 📊 Supply Management

```solidity
MAX_SUPPLY = 1,000,000 tokens (1,000,000 * 10^18 wei)
MINT_AMOUNT = 100 tokens per mint
MAX_MINTS = 10,000 total mints possible
```

**View Functions Added:**
- `remainingSupply()` - Returns how many tokens can still be minted
- `remainingMints()` - Returns how many mint calls are left

### 🎯 Centralization Trade-offs

**Why owner-only minting is necessary:**
- X402 payments require server-side verification
- Prevents front-running and payment bypass
- Server wallet controls payment → mint flow
- Supply cap limits maximum damage if compromised

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. ✅ Supply cap prevents unlimited minting
2. ✅ CDP manages private keys (not exposed to application)
3. ✅ Event transparency allows monitoring
4. ✅ Can renounce ownership after distribution complete

### 🚨 Known Risks & Mitigations

#### Risk: Compromised CDP Account
- **Likelihood**: Low (CDP manages keys securely)
- **Impact**: Attacker could mint up to MAX_SUPPLY
- **Mitigation**:
  - Supply cap limits damage
  - Monitor `TokensMinted` events
  - Can renounce ownership when done
  - Use hardware wallet for ownership transfer

#### Risk: Server Vulnerability
- **Likelihood**: Medium (application-level attacks)
- **Impact**: Could trigger unauthorized mints via API
- **Mitigation**:
  - X402 payment verification required
  - Rate limiting (TODO: implement)
  - Server-side validation
  - Monitoring and alerts

#### Risk: MAX_SUPPLY Reached
- **Likelihood**: High (after 10,000 mints)
- **Impact**: No more minting possible
- **Mitigation**:
  - Design consideration (intended behavior)
  - Deploy new contract if needed
  - Set appropriate MAX_SUPPLY for use case

### 🔐 Additional Security Recommendations

#### For Production Deployment:

1. **Add Rate Limiting**
   ```typescript
   // In src/app/api/mint/route.ts
   // TODO: Add rate limiting per address/IP
   ```

2. **Add Monitoring**
   - Watch for `TokensMinted` events
   - Alert on unusual minting patterns
   - Track total supply approaching MAX_SUPPLY

3. **Consider Multi-sig**
   - Transfer ownership to Gnosis Safe
   - Require multiple signatures for ownership transfer
   - Additional protection layer

4. **Audit Before Mainnet**
   - Get professional security audit
   - Test thoroughly on testnet
   - Bug bounty program

5. **Emergency Pause (Optional)**
   ```solidity
   // Consider adding OpenZeppelin's Pausable
   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";
   ```

### 🧪 Testing Recommendations

Before mainnet deployment:

```solidity
// Test scenarios:
1. Mint exactly to MAX_SUPPLY ✅
2. Attempt to exceed MAX_SUPPLY (should revert) ✅
3. Attempt mint from non-owner (should revert) ✅
4. Mint to zero address (should revert) ✅
5. Check event emissions ✅
6. Verify remainingSupply() accuracy ✅
```
