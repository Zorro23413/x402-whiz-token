# Whiz402Token Deployment Guide

## Overview
You've successfully updated your token minting system with the following new parameters:
- **Max Supply**: 999,999,999 tokens (increased from 1,000,000)
- **Mint Amount**: 50,000 tokens per mint (increased from 100)
- **Price**: $1.00 USDC per mint (increased from $0.10)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy the New Token Contract

You have two deployment options:

#### Option A: Using thirdweb (RECOMMENDED - Easiest)

1. Install thirdweb CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g thirdweb
   ```

2. Deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   npx thirdweb deploy src/contracts/Whiz402Token.sol
   ```

3. This will:
   - Compile your contract automatically
   - Open a browser to thirdweb dashboard
   - Let you choose network â†’ **Select "Base" (Chain ID 8453)**
   - Deploy and verify the contract automatically

4. After deployment, copy the contract address (it will look like `0x...`)

#### Option B: Using Remix IDE

1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Create a new file: `Whiz402Token.sol`
3. Copy contents from `src/contracts/Whiz402Token.sol`
4. Add import remapping in Remix settings:
   ```
   @openzeppelin/=https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.0.0/
   ```
5. Compile with Solidity 0.8.20+
6. Connect MetaMask to **Base Mainnet**
7. Deploy using "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
8. Copy the deployed contract address

### Step 2: Transfer Contract Ownership

The contract needs to be owned by your seller account so the backend can mint tokens.

**Your Seller Account**: `0x1088cFcc078A93baD0cef48Bc767Fc639f5bAdF1`

#### If you deployed with thirdweb:
Run the transfer ownership script:
```bash
npm run transfer-ownership
```

#### If you deployed with Remix:
In Remix, call the `transferOwnership` function with:
```
0x1088cFcc078A93baD0cef48Bc767Fc639f5bAdF1
```

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with the new contract address:

```bash
TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...  # Replace with your new contract address
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

1. Commit and push all changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update token contract: 999M supply, 50k tokens per $1 USDC"
   git push
   ```

2. Vercel will automatically redeploy your application

3. Make sure your Vercel environment variables include:
   - `TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` (your new contract address)
   - `CDP_API_KEY_ID`
   - `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET`
   - `CDP_WALLET_SECRET`
   - `NETWORK=base`

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works

1. Go to your deployed site: `https://x402-whiz-token.vercel.app/mint`

2. Connect your wallet

3. Try to mint tokens (you'll pay $1.00 USDC and receive 50,000 tokens)

4. Check the transaction on BaseScan

5. Verify the USDC payment arrived in your seller wallet:
   ```bash
   node check-usdc-balance.mjs
   ```

## Withdrawing Your Earnings

After users mint tokens, you can withdraw USDC to your personal wallet:

1. Edit `scripts/withdraw-usdc.ts` and add your MetaMask address on line 15

2. Run the withdrawal script:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/withdraw-usdc.ts
   ```

3. The script will transfer all USDC from the seller wallet to your personal wallet

**Note**: Make sure the seller wallet has enough ETH for gas fees (~0.001 ETH)
