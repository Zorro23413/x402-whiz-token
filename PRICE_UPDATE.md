### Files Updated

All pricing has been updated to $1.00 in the following files:

1. ✅ `src/middleware.ts` - X402 payment middleware
2. ✅ `src/app/mint/page.tsx` - Frontend UI (price badge + instructions)
3. ✅ `src/app/api/mint/route.ts` - API documentation
4. ✅ `README.md` - Project overview
5. ✅ `MINTING_SETUP.md` - Setup documentation
6. ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment guide
7. ✅ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Technical summary

### How It Works

```
User Flow:
1. Visit /mint page
2. Enter wallet address
3. Click "Mint 100 Tokens"
4. Pay $1.00 USDC via X402
5. Receive 100 tokens instantly

Payment Flow:
User → $1.00 USDC → X402 Protocol → API Verification → Smart Contract → 100 Tokens
```

### Economics

**Per Transaction:**
- User pays: $1.00 USDC
- Gas costs (you pay): ~$0.10-0.50
- Net revenue per mint: ~$0.50-0.90

**At Maximum Supply (10,000 mints):**
- Total user payments: $10,000
- Estimated gas costs: ~$1,000-5,000
- Estimated net revenue: ~$5,000-9,000

### Customizing Price

To change the price in the future, update this value in `src/middleware.ts`:

```typescript
"/api/mint": {
  price: "$1",  // ← Change this value
  network,
  config: {
    description: "Mint 100 X402 tokens",
  },
},
```

Supported formats:
- `"$1"` or `"$1.00"` - US dollars
- `"$0.50"` - Fifty cents
- `"$10"` - Ten dollars

### Testing on Testnet

On Base Sepolia testnet:
- Payment uses testnet USDC (free)
- Your CDP wallet auto-funds from faucet
- Full payment flow simulation
- Zero real cost for testing

### Production Deployment

When deploying to mainnet:
1. Set `NETWORK=base` in Vercel
2. Deploy contract to Base mainnet
3. Real $1.00 USDC payments begin
4. Monitor revenue via blockchain explorer
